# 3DTicTacToe

## Info
- This is a tictactoe game that works slightly different than most. This game idea was introduced to us by our friend and we decided to create a website where we could easily play it. 
- In this game, there exists a master tictactoe board with smaller boards within each position of the master board. 
- If your confused, just follow the colored square to see where you can play next. 
- You can play it at [MohamedHalat.com](https://mohamedhalat.com)

## How to play
- You need 2 players, X and O
- The first player picks any position in any square
- The next player must play in the position in the masterboard corresponding to the square of the smaller board that was clicked
- First to 3 in a row in a smaller board wins that position in the master board
- First to 3 in a row in the master board wins
